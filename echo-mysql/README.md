# echo-mysql
A simple golang based url shortner


# Requirments to run
1. Golang [How to install Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Docker [How to install Docker?](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
3. Keploy [Quick Installation (API test generator)](https://github.com/keploy/keploy?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-installation-api-test-generator)


# Setting up the project
Run the following commands to clone the repository and download the necessary Go modules


``` bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go.git && cd samples-go/echo-mysql
```

## Run the app and Capture the Testcases

``` bash
keploy record -c "docker compose up" --container-name "echo-mysql-container" --buildDelay 60
```

To generate testcases we just need to make some API calls. You can use Postman, Hoppscotch, or simply curl


1. Root Endpoint:
```bash
-> curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/
```


2. Health Check:
```bash
-> curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/healthcheck
```


3. Shorten URL:
```bash
-> curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/shorten -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://github.com"}'
```


4. Resolve shortened code:

```bash
-> curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/resolve/4KepjkTT
```

Now both these API calls were captured as a testcase and should be visible on the Keploy CLI. You should be seeing an app named keploy folder with the test cases we just captured and data mocks created.

## Run the captured testcases

Now that we have our testcase captured, run the test file.

```bash
keploy test -c "docker compose up app" --delay 20
```

So no need to setup dependencies like MySQL, web-go locally or write mocks for your testing. `keploy test ` runs the test cases captured in the previous step. It replays the captured API calls against the application to verify its behavior. 

The application thinks it's talking to MySQL ðŸ˜„.

We will get output something like this:

## Run the app without docker

If youâ€™d prefer to build and run the application locally without Docker, follow these steps:

### Start the MySql Instance

``` bash
sudo docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=uss -p 3306:3306 --rm mysql:latest
```
### Build the application 

prepare the .env file.

```
cp .env.local .env
```

download go modules.

```
go mod download
```

build the app.

``` bash
go build -o echo-mysql .
```

### Capture the Testcases

``` bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy record -c "./echo-mysql"
```

### Run the Testcases

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy test -c "./echo-mysql" --delay 20
```
