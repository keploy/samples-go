# echo-mysql
A simple golang based url shortner


# Requirments to run
1. Golang [How to install Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Docker [How to install Docker?](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


# Setting up the project
Run the following commands to clone the repository and download the necessary Go modules


``` bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go.git && cd samples-go/echo-mysql
go mod download
```


# Running app

## Let's start the MySql Instance

``` bash
sudo docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=uss -p 3306:3306 --rm mysql:latest
```
## Build the application 

``` bash
 go build -o echo-mysql . 
 ```

# Capture the Testcases

``` bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH oss record -c "./echo-mysql"
```

To generate testcases we just need to make some API calls. You can use Postman, Hoppscotch, or simply curl


1. Root Endpoint:
```bash
-> curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/
```


2. Health Check:
```bash
-> curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/healthcheck
```


3. Short URL:
```bash
-> curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/shorten -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://github.com"}'
```


4. Resolve short code:

```bash
-> curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/resolve/4KepjkTT
```

Now both these API calls were captured as a testcase and should be visible on the Keploy CLI. You should be seeing an app named keploy folder with the test cases we just captured and data mocks created.

# Run the captured testcases

Now that we have our testcase captured, run the test file.

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH oss test -c "./echo-mysql" --delay 20
```

So no need to setup dependencies like MySQL, web-go locally or write mocks for your testing.

oss test runs the test cases captured in the previous step. It replays the captured API calls against the application to verify its behavior. 

The application thinks it's talking to MySQL ðŸ˜„

We will get output something like this:
