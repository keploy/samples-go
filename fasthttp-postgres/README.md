# FastHttp-Postgres

A sample application that get, create, update, and delete the data of a user in the database: - 

## Start Users-Profile sample application
```
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go && cd fasthttp-postgres

go mod download
```

## Installation

```bash
curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/install.sh && source install.sh
```

Keploy can be used on Linux, Windows and MacOS through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

> Note: To run Keploy on MacOS through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4252) the version must be ```4.25.2``` or above.

### Let's start the MongoDB Instance
Using the docker-compose file we will start our mongodb instance:-
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d postgres
```

Now, we will create the docker image of our application:-

```bash
go build -cover
```

### Capture the Testcases

```shell
keploy record -c "./app"
```

To generate testcases we just need to make some API calls. You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), or simply `curl`: -

1. Post Requests
```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Author Name"}' http://localhost:8080/authors

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Book Title","author_id":1}' http://localhost:8080/books
```

2. Get Requests
```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/books
```

### Run captured tests

Now that we have our testcase captured, run the test file.

```shell
keploy test -c "./app" --goCoverage --delay 10
```

_Voila! Our testcases have passedðŸ¥³_ . We can also notice that by capturing just few API calls we got around 88.5% of aggregated coverage with keploy generated testcases
