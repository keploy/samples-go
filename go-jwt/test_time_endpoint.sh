# This script sends a request to the /check-time endpoint.
# - If run without arguments, it uses the current Unix timestamp (should succeed).
# - If run with a number as an argument, it uses that number as the timestamp.

# Send the request using curl and print the result

echo # Add a newline for cleaner terminal output
