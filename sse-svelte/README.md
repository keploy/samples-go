# Server Side events
A sample app to test Keploy integration capabilities with realtime subscriptions such as SSE

## Installation Setup

#### Server
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go.git && cd samples-go/sse-svelte
go mod download
```

## Installation Keploy

```bash

```

### Start MongoDB Instance 
Using the docker-compose file we will start our mongodb instance:-

```bash
# Start Postgres
docker-compose up mongo
```

### Build Application Binary
Now, we will create the binary of our application:-

```bash
go build -cover
```
Once we have our applicaiton binary ready, we will start the application with keploy to start capturing the testcases.

## Capture the test cases
```bash
sudo -E keploy record "./sse-mongo"
```

### Start the UI
We will capture our test from the UI written in Svelte.js
```bash
cd svelte-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

Now let's click on `GetTime` button to trigger the event. We would notice that keploy will capture those calls : - 
![Testcases](./img/testcase.png?raw=true)

## Run the Testcases
Now let's run the test mode :-

```shell
keploy test -c "./sse-mongo" --delay 10 --goCoverage
```

Output should look like : - 

![Testrun](./img/testrun.png?raw=true)

So no need to setup fake database/apis like Postgres or write mocks for them. Keploy automatically mocks them and, **The application thinks it's talking to MongoDb ðŸ˜„**. And with just few clicks we were able to get 42% code coverage of our go backend application.
